# HammerTestbed

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

## Usage

Start the server, then visit `/timestamp`, to get the current time. This request will be denied if
the rate-limit is exceeded (5 requests in 60 seconds).

See `lib/hammer_testbed/application.ex` to see how Hammer and the ETS backend are started.
